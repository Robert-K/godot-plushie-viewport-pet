# Godot Plushie Viewport Pet

This Godot plugin adds a Viewport Pet (like a [Desktop Pet](https://itch.io/games/tag-desktop-pet)) to your Godot Editor!

This cuddly companion walks around, tries to get close to your cursor and even falls asleep when you're not using the editor!

The sprites were done by the talented [SplendidDog](https://splendiddog.itch.io/) and are available on [Itch.io](https://splendiddog.itch.io/simply-plush)!

Feel free to change every aspect of the pet by modifying [godot_plushie.tscn](addons/godot_plushie/godot_plushie.tscn) and [godot_plushie.gd](addons/godot_plushie/godot_plushie.gd)!
